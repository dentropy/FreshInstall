# FreshInstall
<pre>
Ever fuck up your linux install and have to install from scratch?

That happens to me on a regular basis therefore I made this git repo Here I have
scripts that install everything I use on a regular basis and change it depending
on what I need

Next Steps
	skype open source alternative
	configure music player with play lists
	configure ssh proxy
	set up guests accounts and stuff
	Set up VNC server and client
